## Steps to Create GitHub Page
1. Create first a GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com).
2. Create a new repository.
3. Clone the repository from GitHub and start adding the necessary files (.html, .css, .js etc.).
4. Enable GitHub Pages by going to **Settings** of your repository. Scroll down and click Pages. Select the `main` branch and the `root` folder. Then click `save`.
5. After some time, click the website link at `https://[your-username].github.io/[repo-name]`.


## Key Takeaways
- **Redeploying GitHub Pages** is needed to be done everytime there's a new code file added to the repo so that the updated website reflects in the GitHub Pages. 
- **Utilizing GitHub** made me learn some valuable skills (especially the act of version controlling my project).
